This is an example of using Express.

Commands:
---------
npm init -y (package.json appears on project)
npm i express (to install express)

node src/app.js (to run the server)

nodemon src/app.js (start the server and restart when we make changes on our code)

To run nodemon with extensions:
nodemon src/app.js --e

If node_modules need to be generated again (they're not going to be uploaded to git) we need to run:
- npm install
((node_modules are going to be installed using package.json information))

Heroku installation: (Heroku is going to deploy our project on a production environment)
-------------------
sudo snap install --classic heroku (in our project folder)

heroku -v (to get to know heroku installed version)

Login on Heroku by terminal
---------------------------
- heroku login
- press enter key
- internet browser opens and you're now logged if you have an account.

Installing GitHub on our project:
---------------------------------
- add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
- apt update
- apt install git

To know git version installed on our project:
- git --version

Initialize project
------------------
- git init

--->output: Inicializado repositorio Git vac√≠o en /home/berni/Documentos/NodeProjects/webServer/.git/
.git is a folder where is going to be stored all what we change.

- git status (prints the current status of our setup)

To untrack files to git, for example node_modules, we create a new file (.gitignore) and we write files/folders we don't want to upload.

To add all files from a folder to git:
- git add src/

To upload all files of our project:
- git add .
